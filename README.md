# LED-Blinking-System
This project demonstrates the use of Arduino Uno to control two LEDs. The LEDs blink alternately at a fixed delay, simulating timing logic commonly used in embedded systems. The system was designed and tested virtually using the Wokwi simulator. It strengthens understanding of digital output control, pinMode(), and digitalWrite() functions
